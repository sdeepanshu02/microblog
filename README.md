microblog
=========

A decently featured microblogging web application written in Python and Flask.

Installation
------------

The sqlite database must also be created before the application can run, and the `db_create.py` script takes care of that.

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `runp.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
